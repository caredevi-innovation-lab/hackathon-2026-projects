Architecture:
  • Vector DB:   ChromaDB (persistent, local)
  • Embeddings:  sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (via ChromaDB built-in)
  • LLM:         Hugging Face Inference API (same model as the rest of the pipeline)

Flow:
  User question → retrieve top-K relevant medical guidelines →

    """Diabetes Management Guidelines:
- HbA1c target: <7% for most non-pregnant adults; individualise based on age and comorbidities.
- Annual screenings: retinal eye exam, comprehensive foot exam, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, eGFR.
- Blood pressure target: <130/80 mmHg.
- Statin therapy indicated for patients aged 40-75 with diabetes.
- Self-monitoring of blood glucose: frequency based on therapy type.
- Lifestyle modifications: Mediterranean or DASH diet, 150 min/week moderate-intensity exercise, weight management.
- Sick-day rules: continue metformin unless vomiting; hold SGLT2 inhibitors during acute illness.""",

    """Heart Failure Care Coordination Protocol:
- Daily weight monitoring; report weight gain >2 lb overnight or >5 lb in a week.
- Fluid restriction: typically 1.5–2 L/day for NYHA Class III–IV.
- Sodium restriction: <2 g/day.
- Core medications: ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid antagonists, SGLT2 inhibitors.
- Follow-up schedule: within 7–14 days of discharge; then every 1–3 months depending on stability.
- Cardiology referral for EF assessment and device therapy evaluation if EF ≤35%.
- Palliative care discussion for end-stage HF patients.""",

    """Hypertension Follow-Up Protocol:
- Target BP: <130/80 mmHg for most adults; <140/90 for age >80 or significant CKD.
- Lifestyle: DASH diet, sodium <2.3 g/day, 150 min/week aerobic exercise, limit alcohol, smoking cessation.
- Medication adherence review at every visit; pill-burden simplification strategies.
- Screen for end-organ damage: eGFR, urine albumin, retinal exam, ECG.
- In resistant hypertension (BP uncontrolled on 3+ agents including a diuretic), evaluate for secondary causes.""",

    """Post-Acute Discharge & Transitions of Care:
- High-risk patients (LACE score ≥10): follow-up within 48–72 hours of discharge.
- Standard patients: follow-up within 7 days.
- Mandatory medication reconciliation at every care transition.
- Teach-back patient education on: medication names/doses, warning signs, when to call vs. go to ED.
- Home health evaluation for patients with ADL limitations or complex wound care.
- Readmission risk tools: LACE Index, HOSPITAL Score, BOOST tool.""",

    """Care Coordination Best Practices:
- Schedule next appointment before the patient leaves the current encounter.
- Use shared care plans accessible to all members of the care team.
- Identify care coordinator/case manager for patients with 3+ chronic conditions.
- Social determinants of health (SDOH) screening: food insecurity, housing, transportation, social isolation.
- Warm handoffs between providers reduce information loss.
- Integrate behavioral health for patients with comorbid depression/anxiety.""",

    """High-Risk Patient Identification Criteria:
- ≥3 chronic conditions (multi-morbidity).
- Hospitalisation or ED visit in the past 30 days.
- ≥5 medications (polypharmacy).
- Limited health literacy or language barriers.
- Known non-adherence history.
- Frailty score ≥4 (Clinical Frailty Scale).
- Lack of primary care provider or care fragmentation.
- Cognitive impairment affecting self-management.""",

    """COPD Management & Care Coordination:
- Maintenance inhalers: LABA/LAMA combination for GOLD Group B/E.
- Pulmonary rehabilitation recommended for patients with MRC dyspnoea grade ≥2.
- Annual influenza vaccine; pneumococcal vaccine per schedule.
- Exacerbation action plan: rescue inhaler, oral corticosteroids, antibiotics supply.
- Smoking cessation as highest-priority intervention.
- Oxygen therapy if resting SpO2 ≤88% on two occasions.
- Follow-up within 4 weeks after an exacerbation.""",

    """Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Monitoring:
- Monitor eGFR and urine ACR every 3–12 months based on CKD stage and risk.
- BP target: <130/80; first-line agents ACE inhibitor or ARB.
- Avoid NSAIDs and nephrotoxic agents.
- Dietary: protein restriction 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day in advanced CKD; potassium and phosphorus restriction as needed.
- Refer to nephrology when eGFR <30 (Stage 4).
- Anaemia management: target haemoglobin 10–11.5 g/dL with ESA therapy.
- Plan for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant) discussion when eGFR <20.""",
