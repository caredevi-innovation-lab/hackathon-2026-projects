"""Mock third-party ID-verification provider.

Real-world equivalents are Persona, Stripe Identity, Onfido, Veriff, etc.
Each exposes roughly the same shape:
  1. Server creates a verification session for a user, gets back a session id
     and a hosted URL the user opens to upload their ID.
  2. User completes the flow on the provider's site (selfie + ID document).
  3. Provider posts a webhook back to us (or we poll) with `verified: bool`.

We wrap that contract behind a `IdVerifier` abstract class so the whole module
can be swapped out for a real provider later by editing one factory function.

For the demo we ship a `MockIdVerifier` that completes synchronously when the
user clicks a button on a fake hosted page we serve from /api/verify/mock/...
The session id is deterministic-looking ('mock_verif_<hex>') so the demo can
talk about a real-looking integration without needing real credentials.
